Just walked out of Fountain of Youth and my brain feels like a blender on the blitz. Goop flying everywhere, bits of existential dread splattering on the walls. First off, the color palette - like someone spilled a box of crayons in a laundromat and decided it was good enough for the set. Seriously, was the neon green forest thing necessary or was the director just feeling extra chaotic that day? Probably both.  

And the plot? I mean, if you can call it that - it kind of wobbled between “Look, I discovered eternal life!” and “Oh no, eternal life actually kinda sucks.” Gee, you think?? Like finding the fountain of youth is the ultimate life 𝘩𝘢𝘤𝘬 only to realize it's not just glitch-𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 software. 

> There’s that scene where the protagonist, uh, what’s-her-name, leaps into this crystalline waterfall looking for immortality but ends up just drenched and frozen, literally. The metaphor’s thicker than molasses, and I swear if one more character whispers cryptic nonsense about time being a cycle or a flat circle or an awkward squiggly line, I might just scream. Or laugh. Probably both.

But let's talk characters. They’re as unpredictable as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. Just when you think you have a grasp on someone’s motives—bam!—it’s like they’re auditioning for a completely different 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. Would it have killed them to let a side character 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬 a joke or two? Lighten up the overwhelmingly poetic musings, please.

Back to the pacing - God, the pacing! It’s like running through molasses. The first half crawled, and just when I thought it had yawned itself to sleep, everything kicked into a relentless sprint. It exhausted me. Emergency brake needed, STAT. But still... underneath the irritations, a wisp of charm. Those few fleeting moments that hit you right in the feels, the ones that make you think, “Huh, maybe eternally youth-ifying waterfalls aren’t all bad.” 

So, would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? Probably not. But isn’t that half the fun? Stumbling out of the theatre, petulant and pondering where three hours of your life disappeared to, feeling like 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   just to hit pause and sip some coffee at crucial confusing spots. But I’m glad I went. And who knows? Ask me tomorrow and I might declare it a misunderstood masterpiece. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you dare, or don’t. I need a nap.
